# Risk Management

Risk management in cybersecurity is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to an organization's information assets. This section provides a script for automated risk assessment and explains risk management frameworks.

## Risk Assessment Script

The script `risk_assessment.py` performs a simple risk assessment by calculating the risk level based on impact and likelihood.

### Example Usage

1. **Prepare Input Data**: Create an Excel file with columns for different risk factors, including Impact and Likelihood (`examples/sample_risk_assessment.xlsx`).
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to generate a risk assessment report.
