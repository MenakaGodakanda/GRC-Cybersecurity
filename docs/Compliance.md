# Compliance

Compliance in cybersecurity ensures that an organization adheres to relevant laws, regulations, and standards. This section provides a script for checking compliance against specified requirements.

## Compliance Check Script

The script `compliance_check.py` checks data against a configuration of compliance requirements.

### Example Usage

1. **Prepare Configuration File**: Create a YAML file defining compliance criteria (`configs/grc_tool_config.yaml`).
2. **Prepare Input Data**: Create an Excel file with data to be checked (`examples/sample_compliance_data.xlsx`).
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to generate a compliance report. The `compliance_check.py` script will generate a compliance report and save it in `reports/compliance_report.xlsx`.
